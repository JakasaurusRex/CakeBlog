## October 3rd 2024, Falling into the Void üï≥Ô∏èüçÇüéµ

As we enter fall, our Creative Embedded Sytems class was tasked to create an art display with the theme "**Fall**" using our ESP32 TTGo T-Display devices. I created "**Fall**ing into the Void", a display that evokes feeling of serenity and peace while you float away on your bed listening to music. Here is what my final display looked like!

# The Fall
When I first heard the theme, I immediately thought of scenes from the Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom where Link, the protagonist, dives into the unknown from islands high above the lands of Hyrule. While you are falling you are able to truly witness the vastness of the kingdom of Hyrule and the regions to explore. During these times playing the game I feel excitement about all the things to do and see, but also I feel peace. The wind blowing against your face and slowly floating in the air above an unexplored world.

Originally, I wanted to explore this idea, but I was having difficulty figuring out how to spin it in a unique way that felt substantial. Becasue of this I decided to reroute my idea and try to explore the idea of peace while falling in a different lens. I was laying on my bed listening to music trying to brainstorm ideas when the idea of what I was currently doing came to me. I thought of the peace felt from getting home from a long day or work or school and just sitting on my bed and floating away and I wanted to lean into that. 

# Jumping In
I knew that I wanted to use pixel art in someway so I started my work by designing the character that would be floating in the void. I wanted the character to be wearing headphones and listening to music. I chose a color pallete in Lospec, a pixel art community website, that matched the vibes of this feeling in my head. I chose a palette with lots of warmer blues and some yellows and oranges so that I could make things that standout against a black background, which was my idea at the time for where the character would be floating. 

I then started my work in Aseprite, my preferred pixel art editor, and came up with a couple of designs but these are the finals ones that I came up with for the character that would be floating and the music notes that would accompany them.

When creating the character I wanted them to look comfy while also looking somewhat curious of their surroundings. I used art from the [Celeste official sountrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZEObeV7bYc) as one of my inspirations and also this pixel art by user [@Lovethefox on PixilArt](https://www.pixilart.com/art/falling-into-the-void-848b278152eaa13)
